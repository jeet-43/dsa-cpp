## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is my active DSA practice log — problems solved in **C++** with clean, readable code and a focus on understanding the *why* behind each approach, not just getting an accepted verdict.

Started on **January 1, 2026** as a daily commitment. Built alongside my DSA course at **Coding Blocks, NSP** and daily LeetCode practice.

```cpp
// The approach
for (auto& problem : problems) {
    understand(problem);          // don't just solve — understand
    identify(problem.pattern);    // arrays? recursion? DP?
    implement(cleanSolution);     // write readable, efficient code
    analyze(time, space);         // always check complexity
    commit();                     // push it. document it.
}
```
